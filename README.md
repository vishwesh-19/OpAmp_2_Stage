# OpAmp_2_Stage
Designed a Two-Stage Operational Amplifier with gpdk 180nm technology node using Cadence Virtuoso simulation. Amplifier was configured to attain a \textbf{DC gain} of 60dB, a phase margin $\ge$ 60 degrees, a slew rate of 20 V/$\mu$sec, unity gain frequency of 30MHz and power dissipation of $\le$ 300 $\mu$watt while it drove a capacitance $C_{L}$ = 2pF.
